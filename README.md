<h3>Set up the deployment environment</h3>
<h5>AWS</h5>
First, go to https://aws.amazon.com/ and create a free-tier account.
Then, choose the EC2 service.
After that, you have to pick on what OS the server will run. Choose Debian-11.
Then you get the option to configure the specs of the server through the 'instance-type'. We chose t2-micro.
<h5>SSH Access</h5>
To configure the SSH access to the cloud we used PuTTY. It can be downloaded from https://www.putty.org/.
From here on we have to configure the PuTTY with the .pem key we get from AWS.
<h5>Installing packages</h5>
You can install the packages you need with debian commands through the shell.
